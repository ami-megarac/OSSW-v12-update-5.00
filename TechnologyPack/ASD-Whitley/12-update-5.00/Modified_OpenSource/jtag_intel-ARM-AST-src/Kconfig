menuconfig JTAG
	tristate "JTAG support"
	help
	  This provides basic core functionality support for JTAG class devices.
	  Hardware that is equipped with a JTAG microcontroller can be
	  supported by using this driver's interfaces.
	  This driver exposes a set of IOCTLs to the user space for
	  the following commands:
	    SDR: Performs an IEEE 1149.1 Data Register scan
	    SIR: Performs an IEEE 1149.1 Instruction Register scan.
	    RUNTEST: Forces the IEEE 1149.1 bus to a run state for a specified
	    number of clocks or a specified time period.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called jtag.

menuconfig JTAG_ASPEED
	tristate "Aspeed SoC JTAG controller support"

	help
	  This provides a support for Aspeed JTAG device, equipped on
	  Aspeed SoC 24xx and 25xx families. Drivers allows programming
	  of hardware devices, connected to SoC through the JTAG interface.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called jtag-aspeed.
