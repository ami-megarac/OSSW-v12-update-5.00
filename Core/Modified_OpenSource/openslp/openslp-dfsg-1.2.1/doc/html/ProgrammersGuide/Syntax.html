SLP Syntaxes</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
<a NAME="Service Type"></a>SLP Service Type Syntax</h3>
The official definition of Service Type strings can be found in <a href="../../rfc/rfc2609.txt">RFC
2609</a>, "Service Templates and Service Schemes".&nbsp; If you will be
working with "well known" (IANA) service types, you should read it.&nbsp;
If you are developing applications for "proprietary" services then you
will probably be satisfied with the following explanation:
<blockquote><b>Service-Type = "service:"&lt;abstract-type.naming-authority>":"&lt;concrete-type></b></blockquote>
The abstract-type is simple (hopefully short) descriptive string that describes
the type of service.&nbsp; The naming-authority is the name (hopefully
unique) name of the organization that named the service.&nbsp; The naming-authority
is optional, but if it is omitted then IANA is assumed to be the naming
authority and IANA requires service-types to be registered (see RFC 2609).&nbsp;
The concrete-type is also optional.&nbsp; Think of a concrete-type as a
kind of sub-type of the abstract-type.&nbsp; For example, "printer" is
an abstract type (owned by IANA) and "printer:lpr" is a concrete type (owned
by IANA).
<h4>
Service Type Examples</h4>
"weather.nasa:wtp"&nbsp; - A (fictitious) weather service type owned by
NASA that uses WTP protocol
<br>"weather.nasa:swtp" - A (fictitious) weather service type owned by NASA
that uses SWTP protocol.
<br>"chat.superchat" - A chat service type owned by SuperChat
<br>"printer.samba" - A samba printer service type
<br>"ftp" - An IANA ftp service type
<br>"telnet" - An IANA telnet service type
<h4>
Comparing Service Types</h4>
Since service types are an important in determining the urls that are return
by the <tt><a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs()</a></tt> call you should
understand how OpenSLP compares services.&nbsp; Suppose that three services
were registered with <tt><a href="SLPReg.html">SLPReg()</a></tt> using
a <tt>srvtype</tt> of "printer:lpr", "printer" and "printer.acme".&nbsp;
If a client program calls <tt><a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs()</a></tt>
with a <tt>srvtype</tt> of "service:printer" the urls for both "printer:lpr"
and "printer" are returned ("printer.acme" is not).&nbsp; However, if <tt><a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs()</a></tt>
is called with <tt>srvtype </tt>of "printer:lpr" or "printer.acme" then
the urls for "printer:lpr" or "printer.acme" would be returned.&nbsp; In
other words, if a concrete type is used, only services with same abstract
and concrete type are returned.&nbsp; If only the abstract type is used
then all services of that abstract type (and naming authority) are returned.
<h4>
A word about naming authorities</h4>
It is our opinion that developers MUST use a naming authority if an IANA
service template has not been defined that fits the type of service that
is being supplied by their application.&nbsp; If developers use a predefined
IANA service template they must use it correctly.
<h3>
<a NAME="Service Url"></a>SLP Service Url Syntax</h3>
URL strings passed as parameters to<tt> <a href="SLPReg.html">SLPReg()</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPDereg.html">SLPDeReg()</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPDelAttrs.html">SLPDelAttrs()</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs()</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPParseSrvURL.html">SLPParseSrvURL()</a></tt>
functions and returned as a result to the <tt><a href="SLPSrvURLCallback.html">SLPSrvURLCallback()</a></tt>
callback function.&nbsp; SLP defines a special type of URL called a Service
URL that MUST be used when calling OpenSLP API functions.&nbsp; If you
decide to use Service URLs extensively, you should probably read <a href="rfc/rfc2609.txt">RFC
2609</a>, but if you just want to know what they look like, the following
explanation should be good enough:
<blockquote><b><tt>SLP Service URL = "service:"&lt;service-type>"://"&lt;addrspec></tt></b></blockquote>
The <tt>service-type</tt> is a service type as explained above. <tt>addrspec</tt>
can be just about anything you want that fits URL syntax (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
) and can be translated as a network location.&nbsp; The "<tt>service:</tt>"
and "<tt>://</tt>" strings are required.
<h4>
Service URL Examples</h4>
"service:weather.nasa:wtp://weather.nasa.com:12000"
<br>"service:weather.nasa:swtp://weather.nasa.com:12001"
<br>"service:chat.superchat://chat.superchat.com;auth=ldap"
<h4>
Do I have to use the SLP Service URL syntax for my urls?</h4>
Yes.&nbsp; With OpenSLP you are required to use Service URLs, API functions
will return SLP_PARSE_ERROR if you do not.&nbsp; The reason that OpenSLP
requires Service URLs is because the SLP API designers do not allow the
service-type to be passed in as a parameter to the SLPDeReg() call.&nbsp;
With out the service-type, SLPDeReg() does not allow the caller to distinguish
between services of varying types that were registered with the same standard
URL.

<h3>
<a NAME="LDAPv3 Filter"></a>LDAPv3 Search Filter Syntax</h3>
An LDAP Search Filter string is passed parameter to the <a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs()</a>
function.&nbsp; If you want the definitive explanation of LDAP3 search
filters you can read <a href="../../rfc/rfc2254.txt">RFC 2254</a>, "String
Representation of LDAP Search Filters", or you can read the following definition
that should be good enough for most applications.
