<h2>
SLPError Codes</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The following is an explanation of the SLP error codes are returned
by SLP functions:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE><a NAME="SLP_LAST_CALL"></a>SLP_LAST_CALL</td>

<td>1</td>

<td>Passed to callback functions when the API library has no more data
for them and therefore no further calls will
<br>be made to the callback on the currently outstanding operation. The
callback can use this to signal the main body of the client code that no
more data will be forthcoming on the operation, so that the main body of
the client code can break out of data collection loops. On the last call
of a callback during both a synchronous and synchronous call, the error
code parameter has value SLP_LAST_CALL, and the other parameters are all
NULL. If no results are returned by an API operation, then only one call
is made, with the error parameter set to SLP_LAST_CALL.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_OK"></a>SLP_OK</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>indicates that the no error occurred during the operation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED"></a>SLP_LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED</td>

<td>-1</td>

<td>No DA or SA has service advertisement or attribute information in the
language requested, but at least one DA or SA indicated, via the LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED
error code, that it might have information for that service in another
language</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="PARSE_ERROR"></a>SLP_PARSE_ERROR</td>

<td>-2</td>

<td>The SLP message was rejected by a remote SLP agent. The API returns
this error only when no information was retrieved, and at least one SA
or DA indicated a protocol error. The data supplied through the API may
be malformed or a may have been damaged in transit.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="INVALID_REGISTRATION"></a>SLP_INVALID_REGISTRATION</td>

<td>-3</td>

<td>The API may return this error if an attempt to register a service was
rejected by all DAs because of a malformed URL or attributes. SLP does
not return the error if at least one DA accepted the registration.&nbsp;
The deregistered service url does not conform to valid service url syntax.&nbsp;
The service url being deregistered is not registered this means that either
it was never registered via a call to SLPReg() or that the registration
lifetime has expired.&nbsp;&nbsp; SLP_INVALID_REGISTRATION is commonly
returned when an attempt is made to deregister a service that was registered
by a call to SLPReg() on a different host.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED"></a>SLP_SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED</td>

<td>-4</td>

<td>The API returns this error if the SA has been configured with net.slp.useScopes
value-list of scopes and the SA request did not specify one or more of
these allowable scopes, and no others. It may be returned by a DA or SA
if the scope included in a request is not supported by the DA or SA.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT"></a>SLP_AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT</td>

<td>-6</td>

<td>If the SLP framework supports authentication, this error arises when
the UA or SA failed to send an authenticator for requests or registrations
in a protected scope.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="AUTHENTICATION_FAILED"></a>SLP_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED</td>

<td>-7</td>

<td>If the SLP framework supports authentication, this error arises when
a authentication on an SLP message failed</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_INVALID_UPDATE"></a>SLP_INVALID_UPDATE</td>

<td>-13</td>

<td>An update for a non-existing registration was issued, or the update
includes a service type or scope different than that in the initial registration,
etc.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_REFRESH_REJECTED"></a>SLP_REFRESH_REJECTED</td>

<td>-15</td>

<td>The SA attempted to refresh a registration more frequently than the
minimum refresh interval. The SA should call the appropriate API function
to obtain the minimum refresh interval to use.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED"></a>SLP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</td>

<td>-17</td>

<td>If an unimplemented feature is used, this error is returned.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_BUFFER_OVERFLOW"></a>SLP_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</td>

<td>-18</td>

<td>An outgoing request overflowed the maximum network MTU size. The request
should be reduced in size or broken into pieces and tried again.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_NETWORK_TIMED_OUT"></a>SLP_NETWORK_TIMED_OUT</td>

<td>-19</td>

<td>When no reply can be obtained in the time specified by the configured
timeout interval for a unicast request, this error is returned.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_NETWORK_INIT_FAILED"></a>SLP_NETWORK_INIT_FAILED</td>

<td>-20</td>

<td>If the network cannot initialize properly, this error is returned.
Will also be returned if an SA or DA agent (slpd) can not be contacted.
See SLPReg() and SLPDeReg() for more information.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_MEMORY_ALLOC_FAILED"></a>SLP_MEMORY_ALLOC_FAILED&nbsp;</td>

<td>-21</td>

<td>Out of memory error</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_PARAMETER_BAD"></a>SLP_PARAMETER_BAD</td>

<td>-22</td>

<td>If a parameter passed into a function is bad, this error is returned.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_NETWORK_ERROR"></a>SLP_NETWORK_ERROR</td>

<td>-23</td>

<td>The failure of networking during normal operations causes this error
to be returned.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_INTERNAL_SYSTEM_ERROR"></a>SLP_INTERNAL_SYSTEM_ERROR</td>

<td>-24</td>

<td>A basic failure of the API causes this error to be returned. This occurs
when a system call or library fails. The operation could not recover.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_HANDLE_IN_USE"></a>SLP_HANDLE_IN_USE</td>

<td>-25</td>

<td>In the C API, callback functions are not permitted to recursively call
into the API on the same SLPHandle, either directly or indirectly. If an
attempt is made to do so, this error is returned from the called API function.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="SLP_TYPE_ERROR"></a>SLP_TYPE_ERROR&nbsp;</td>

<td>-26</td>

<td>If the API supports type checking of registrations against service
type templates, this error can arise if the attributes in a registration
do not match the service type template for the service.</td>
