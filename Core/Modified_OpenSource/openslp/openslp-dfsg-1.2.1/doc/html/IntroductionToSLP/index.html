<h3>What Is Service Location Protocol?</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Service Location Protocol</span>
(SLP) was originally an <span style="font-style: italic;">Internet
Engineering Task Force</span> (IETF) standards track protocol that
provides a framework to allow networking applications to discover the
existence,
location, and configuration of networked services in enterprise
networks.
Traditionally, in order to locate services on the network, users of
network
applications have been required to supply the host name or network
address
of the machine that provides a desired service. Ensuring that
users
and applications are supplied with the correct information has, in many
cases, become an administrative nightmare.
</p>
<p>Protocols that support service location are often taken for granted,
mostly because they are already included (without fanfare) in many
network
operating systems. For example, without Microsoft's SMB service
location
facilities, "Network Neighborhood" could not discover services
available
for use on the network and Novell NetWare would be unable to locate
eDirectory trees. Nevertheless, an IETF sponsored protocol for service
location was not
standardized
until the advent of SLP. Because it is not tied to a proprietary
technology, SLP provides a service location solution that could become
extremely important (especially on Unix) platforms.<br>
</p>
<h3>About this Document</h3>
Like all IETF standards, SLP is described in great detail by documents
called Request
For Comments (RFC's). IETF RFCs are usually lengthy, very detailed,
and written using precise language and notations. This
whitepaper, on the other hand, was written to give a general overview
of
SLP. This document will, by nature, omit important details that would
be
interesting
to the more technical reader. For these details, the reader is referred
the
following RFCs:
<blockquote><a href="../../rfc/rfc2165.txt">RFC 2165</a> - Service
Location
Protocol, Version 1<br>
  <a href="../../rfc/rfc2608.txt">RFC 2608</a> - Service Location
Protocol,
Version 2<br>
  <a href="../../rfc/rfc2609.txt">RFC 2609</a> - Service Templates and
Service Schemes<br>

Location
Protocol</blockquote>
<h3>
SLP for Users and Administrators</h3>
SLP can eliminate the need for users to know the names of network
hosts. With SLP, the user only needs to know the description of the
service he
is interested in. Based on this description, SLP is then able to
return the URL of the desired service.
<p>Consider the following example of a new employee setting up his
workstation
to use one of the department printers. Here's a dialog between this new
employee (<span style="font-style: italic;">Newbie</span>), and his
coworker (<span style="font-style: italic;">Stan</span>), who's been
around for a while: <br>
</p>
<blockquote><b><u>Traditional</u></b> <br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Newbie</span>: "Hey Stan, the setup
program is asking me for the name
of our printer. What should I type in?"<br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Stan</span>: "Which printer do you
want?"<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Newbie</span>: "The big one by the copier."<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Stan</span>: "I've heard it doesn't work
well with postscript
applications. You'll have to use the one down the hall."<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Newbie</span>: "Ok. What should I type in."<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Stan</span>: "Actually, I don't know; I
use the one by the copier. You'll
probably have to call the IS help desk."<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Newbie</span>: &lt;groan&gt; ...
  <p><b><u>With SLP</u></b> <br>
A setup program uses SLP to display to the user the description
(including
location) of the printers that work with postscript. The user selects
one
that is close to his office. The SLP service returns all necessary
addressing information directly to his device setup application.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

<h3>SLP for Software Developers</h3>
In many cases, SLP can eliminate the need for software applications to
prompt users for host names, or to read host names from configuration
files.
<p>Consider the following example of a software engineer who is writing
an LDAP-enabled application.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<blockquote><b><u>Traditional</u></b> <br>
Currently, the only way to know the hostname of the LDAP server to
use in the call to ldap_init() is to read it from a configuration
file.
The configuration file must be created at install time and updated as
the
location of the LDAP server changes. Keeping this configuration
file
up to date becomes a real problem, especially when the LDAP application
is installed on a laptop that connects to various networks.
  <p><b><u>With SLP</u></b> <br>
The developer uses SLP to obtain the host names and attributes of LDAP
servers that are displayed to the user at install time, and again if
the
user desires to connect to a different LDAP server.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As illustrated in the example above, SLP does not always eliminate
the
need to prompt users for information.&nbsp; However, it does allow the
software developer to present a descriptive list of services that can
be
understood by the user.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<h3>
Agents</h3>
In order to understand the rest of this document (as well as all other
SLP documentation), you will need to know about SLP <span
 style="font-style: italic;">agents</span>. In
SLP
an agent is a software entity that processes SLP protocol
messages.
There are three types of SLP agents:
&nbsp;<br>
<blockquote><b>User Agent (UA)</b> <br>
The SLP <span style="font-style: italic;">User Agent</span> is a
software entity that is looking for the
location
of one or more services. Usually implemented (at least partially), as a
library to which client applications link, it provides client
applications with a simple interface for accessing SLP registered
service information.
  <p><b>Service Agent (SA)</b> <br>
The SLP <span style="font-style: italic;">Service Agent</span> is a
software entity that advertises the location
of one or more services. SLP advertisement is designed to be both
scalable and effective, minimizing the use of network bandwidth through
the use of targeted multi-cast messages, and uni-cast responses to
queries. </p>
  <p><b>Directory Agent(DA)</b> <br>
The SLP <span style="font-style: italic;">Directory Agent</span> is a
software entity that acts as a centralized
repository for service location information. Both Service Agents and
User Agents make it a priority to discover available Directory Agents,
as using a Directory Agent minimizes the amount of multi-cast messages
sent by the protocol on the network.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
Messages</h3>
In order to be able to provide a "framework" for service location, SLP
agents communicate with each other using eleven (11) different types of
messages. The dialog between agents is usually limited to very
simple
exchanges of request and reply messages.
<blockquote><b>Service Request (SrvRqst)</b> <br>
Message sent by UA's to SA's and DA's to request the location of a
service.
  <p><b>Service Reply (SrvRply)</b> <br>
Message sent by SA's and DA's in response to a SrvRqst message. The
SrvRply
contains the URL of the requested service. </p>
  <p><b>Service Registration (SrvReg)</b> <br>
Message sent by SA's to DA's containing information about a service
that
is available. </p>
  <p><b>Service Deregister (SrvDeReg)</b> <br>
Message sent by SA's to inform DA's that a service is no longer
available. </p>
  <p><b>Service Acknowledge (SrvAck)</b> <br>
A generic acknowledgment that is sent by DA's to SA's in response to
SrvReg
and SrvDeReg messages. </p>
  <p><b>Attribute Request (AttrRqst)</b> <br>
Message sent by UA's to request the attributes of a service. </p>
  <p><b>Attribute Reply (AttrRply)</b> <br>
Message sent by SA's and DA's in response to a AttrRqst. The AttrRply
contains the list of attributes that were requested. </p>
  <p><b>Service Type Request (SrvTypeRqst)</b> <br>
Message sent by UA's to SA's and DA's requesting the types of services
that are available. </p>
  <p><b>Service Type Reply (SrvTypeRply)</b> <br>
Message by SA's and DA's in response to a SrvTypeRqst. The SrvTypeRply
contains a list of requested service types. </p>
  <p><b>DA Advertisement (DAAdvert)</b> <br>
Message sent by DA's to let SA's and UA's know where they are. </p>
  <p><b>SA Advertisement (SAAdvert)</b> <br>
Message sent by SA's to let UA's know where they are. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
Unicast, Multicast and Broadcast</h3>
SLP is a unicast and multicast protocol. This means that the
messages
described in the previous section can be sent to
one
agent at a time (unicast) or to all agents (that are listening) at the
same time (multicast). A multicast is not a broadcast. In
theory,
broadcast messages are "heard" by <i>every</i> node on the
network. Multicast differs from broadcast because multicast messages
are only
"heard"
by the nodes on the network that have "joined the multicast group" - by
definition, those that are interested in the information.<br>
<p>For obvious reasons, network routers filter almost all broadcast
traffic. This means that broadcasts that are generated on one subnet
will not be
forwarded, or "routed" to any of the other subnets connected to the
router
(from the router's perspective, a subnet is all machines connected to
one
of its ports). Multicast messages, on the other hand, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">are</span> forwarded by
routers. Multicast traffic from a given group is forwarded by routers
to all
subnets
that have at least one machine that is interested in receiving the
multicast
for that group. <br>

<h3>SLP Application Programmer's Interface</h3>
One of the most important parts of the SLP specification is the
standard
<span style="font-style: italic;">Application Programmer's Interface</span>
(API). The SLP API is a library interface
that allows programmers to use SLP in their applications to locate
services. Without the API, SLP would be little more than a
specification. With
the API, developers can add easily add SLP based features to their
programs. The SLP API provides applications with the same sort of
interface to service information that the LDAP client API provides to
LDAP enabled applications. <br>
<p>The following is a list of the major SLP API function calls (more
information
can be found in the <a href="../ProgrammersGuide/index.html">OpenSLP
Programmer's
Guide</a> or <a href="../../rfc/rfc2614.txt">RFC 2614</a>):&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<blockquote> <b>SLPReg()</b> <br>
Registers a service URL and service attributes with SLP.
  <p><b>SLPDeReg()</b> <br>
Deregisters a previously registered service. </p>
  <p><b>SLPFindSrvs()</b> <br>
Finds services based on service type or attributes. </p>
  <p><b>SLPFindAttrs()</b> <br>
Obtains a list of attributes for services registered with SLP. </p>
  <p><b>SLPFindSrvTypes()</b> <br>
Obtains a list of the types of services that have been registered with
SLP. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>
Additional Information</h3>
Technical readers probably have additional questions that are beyond
the
scope of this document.
<p><b>Security</b>
<br>
SLPv2 has been designed to be a secure protocol. When properly
implemented, SLPv2 can ensure integrity and authenticity of data being
transmitted
between SLP agents. See <a href="../../rfc/rfc2608.txt">RFC
2608</a>, section 9.2 for more information.
</p>
<p><b>Scalability</b>
<br>
SLPv2 was designed to be a scalable solution for enterprise service
location. It is not intended to be a solution for the global
Internet.&nbsp;
However, as an enterprise solution, SLP can be configured to use
"scopes"
(see <a href="../../rfc/rfc2608.txt">RFC 2608</a> section 11) and SLP
Directory Agents
in
ways that should allow it to scale well in very larger networks. More
concrete evidence of SLPv2 scalability will become available when SLP
is
more widely used.
</p>
<p><b>Implementations</b>
<br>
The following is a list of known SLP implementations:
</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.openslp.org">OpenSLP</a> <br>
