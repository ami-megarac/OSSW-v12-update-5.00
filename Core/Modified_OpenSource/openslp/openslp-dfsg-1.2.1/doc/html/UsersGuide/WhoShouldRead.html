<h2>
Who should read this guide</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>Often there are significant differences between the behavior of implementations
of standardized protocols.&nbsp; OpenSLP is no different.&nbsp; Every attempt
has been made to follow the specification from the IETF RFCs, but there
still may be subtle differences between OpenSLP and other SLP implementations.&nbsp;
To be informed, even experienced users of SLP should read this guide.
<p>Note: This guide deals with concepts that are <i>specific to using OpenSLP.</i>&nbsp;
If you are looking for an overview of the SLP protocol itself, you should
read "<a href="../IntroductionToSLP/index.html">An Introduction to SLP</a>"
or review the SLP RFCs (<a href="../../rfc/rfc2608.txt">2608</a>, <a href="../../rfc/rfc2609.txt">2609</a>,
<a href="../../rfc/rfc2614.txt">2614</a>).&nbsp; If you are a developer,
you should probably read the <a href="../ProgrammersGuide/index.html">OpenSLP
Programmers Guide.</a>
