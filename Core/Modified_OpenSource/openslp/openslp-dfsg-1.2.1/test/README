Setup
  Perform these steps to setup the program for testing.
    0.  Ensure OpenSLP source tree is installed
    1.  `tar xvfz test-suite.tar.gz' into the openslp directory.
    2.  Perform a root make of Openslp to ensure all libraries are created
    3.  Ensure that libslp.so.0.*.* is sym linked to libslp.so in the libslp 
        directory.

Executing Tests
  Go into the root directory and type the following commands:
    make clean
    make 
    make test
  All tests are passed if the Makefile exits normally.
