An IP multicast-enabled kernel is recommended to reduce traffic.
OpenSLP will continue to work even without multicast support in the kernel, by
using broadcasts. However, broadcasts are less efficient on the network, so if
you don't already use one, please consider upgrading to a multicast-enabled
kernel.
